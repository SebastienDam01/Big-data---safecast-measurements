# Big-data_Safecast-measurements

This is a project part of the course NF26 - Big data and data warehouse. <br> <br>
I studied the dataset Safecast Radiation Measurements containing 82282963 rows. I used **Cassandra** and **Spark** to retrieve the distribution of measures, search for the most radioactive areas across the world, etc. See my code and report for my details.
